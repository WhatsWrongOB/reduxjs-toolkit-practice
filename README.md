## Introduction

Redux Toolkit simplifies global state management in React/Next.js apps by reducing boilerplate and providing tools like `createSlice`, `createAsyncThunk`, and `configureStore` to manage complex state logic efficiently.

In this project, we've integrated Redux Toolkit with Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side state management.

## Features

- Global state management using **Redux Toolkit**
- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** and **static site generation (SSG)** with Next.js
- Asynchronous actions handled via **`createAsyncThunk`**
- Centralized store setup with Redux's **`configureStore`**
- Seamless **Redux DevTools** support
- Easy-to-understand slice-based state management

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** – for server-side rendering and static site generation
- **Redux Toolkit** – for global state management
- **React** – for building the user interface
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** – for component logic
- **Redux Thunk** – for handling asynchronous actions
